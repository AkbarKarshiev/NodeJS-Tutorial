## Lesson 39 - Thread Pool Size

### Experiment 1 Inference
- By increasing the thread pool size, we are able to improve the total time taken to run multiple calls of 
an asynchronous method like pbkdf2

### Experiment 2 Inference
- Increasing the thread pool size can help with performance but that is limited by the number of available CPU cores
