Types of Streams:

1. Readable streams from which data can be read
    Ex: Reading from a file as readable stream
2. Writable streams to which we can write data
    Ex: Writing to a file as writable stream
3. Duplex streams that are both Readable and Writable
    Ex: Sockets as a duplex stream
4. Transform streams that can modify or transform the data as it is written and read
    Ex: File compression where you can write compressed data and read de-compressed data to and from a file as transform stream
